Help me manage the task: "$ARGUMENTS"

Analyze the task and:
- Break it down into actionable steps if complex
- Identify any dependencies or prerequisites
- Suggest a timeline and priority level
- Create or update relevant tracking files
- Set up any necessary automation or reminders

Focus on making the task clear, actionable, and integrated with the broader LifeOps system.
