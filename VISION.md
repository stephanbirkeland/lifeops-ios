# LifeOps Vision

## Purpose

LifeOps is a private, personal life management system designed to take control of all aspects of private life and home. It is a service that serves **me** - not corporations, advertisers, or data collectors.

## Core Philosophy

- **Privacy First**: All data stays private and under my control
- **Intentional Technology**: Technology should improve life, not consume it
- **Unified Experience**: One system across all devices and interfaces
- **Proactive Assistance**: Help me live better, not just react to requests

## Current Daily Reality

### Weekday Routine

| Time | Activity | Pain Point |
|------|----------|------------|
| Morning | Wake up | Want to wake early enough for 1h workout |
| Morning | Shower | Listen to music on Google speaker in bathroom |
| Day | Work | Sometimes work too long |
| Evening | Home | Dinner, TV, chores, cleaning, or social activities |
| Night | Bed | Go to bed way too late |

### Weekend Pattern

- Weekends are unpredictable and variable
- Options include:
  - **Summer cabin** - Close by, easy access
  - **Winter cabin** - ~4 hours away
  - **Stay home** - When no plans or prefer to relax
